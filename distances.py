# # Distances

# ### TO DISCUSS:
# ####  1) At what point will we turn distances > cutoff into NaN values?
# ####  2) What units will we use (length, time, energy...)?
# ####  3) Which variables should be globalized?
# ####  4) Forget about symmetrization?
# ####  5) Plotting with respect to PBC is an actual piece of work (include acceleration vectors) 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# ### NOTES TO SELF:
# #### 1) The largest possible distance between two points with PBC is   $\Large \frac{Boxlength}{\sqrt{2}}$
#

#INPUT: coordinate array of particles of shape (n,2)
#OUTPUT: array of connecting vectors of all particles of shape (n,n,2)

#This function will normalize the list of connecting vectors obtained from function 'vectors'
